# Git Workflow

## Branch Strategy
- `main`: production-ready
- `develop`: integration branch
- `feature/*`: new features
- `fix/*`: bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: urgent production fixes

## Commit Hygiene
- Atomic commits (one logical change)
- Sign commits when possible
- Never commit secrets/credentials
- Update .gitignore before adding files

## PR Standards
- Branch protection on main/develop
- Require review for merge
- Squash or rebase (no merge commits)
- Delete branch after merge
